Privacy Policy

PREFACE
We are committed to protecting your privacy while keeping our operational costs low, because we're not data-hungry
    vampires.
This policy explains our data practices for the Discord Application and all related services (the "Service").

INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We strive to collect as little as possible.
Non-PII: We collect technical data needed for the Service to work, like your Discord User ID, Server ID, command logs,
    and virtual identities (e.g., game character names/stats).
No Real PII: We do not intentionally request or store real-world Personally Identifiable Information (real name, home
    address, etc.). We don't want it.

LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING (THE WHY)
Under the UK GDPR, we process your data based on:
    a) Contractual Necessity: We need your ID to know who you are so the bot can actually reply to you.
        Without this, the Service doesn't work.
    b) Legitimate Interest: We log errors and usage to keep the bot from crashing and to ban bad actors.

USER-SUBMITTED DATA
If you voluntarily provide real-world PII in any free-form text field (like a bio or command argument), you do so at
    your own risk.
We make reasonable security attempts but assume no responsibility or liability for it.
Seriously, why would you do that?

DATA STORAGE AND DELETION
To keep costs low, our data retention is minimal. We are big fans of the 'delete' key.
    a) Unmanaged Data: Data from inactive accounts or old logs may be permanently deleted at any time without notice
        primarily to manage costs.
    b) Audit Data: Images or large artifacts may be processed for metadata, and the original deleted immediately
        primarily to manage costs.
This data is a privilege, not a right. We may purge it without notice. Poof. Gone.

HOW WE USE & SHARE INFORMATION
We use collected info solely to operate, maintain, and provide the Service.
    a) Third-Party APIs: We transmit data to third-party platforms to make the bot work.
        This includes Discord (obviously) and game APIs like Cloud Imperium Games (CIG).
        We do not control how they handle your data once it leaves our hands.
    b) International Transfers: Since Discord is global, your data may travel outside the UK/EEA.
        By using the bot, you accept that your data might go on a holiday to a server farm in Virginia.
Your interaction with Discord is governed by their policies. That's a "you and them" problem.

DATA SECURITY & LIABILITY
We implement best-effort security, but no system is 100% secure. We're not Fort Knox.
If we learn of a significant security issue, we'll make a best-effort attempt to inform you.
However, our liability for any data breach or loss is strictly limited as defined in our Terms of Service (Section 11).
For the record: That cap is the greater of £50.00 GBP or the lesser of what you paid for the affected period vs. 3
    months' fees. Don't plan your retirement on suing us.

YOUR RIGHTS (GDPR/UK DATA LAWS)
Under UK law, you have rights. Here is how we handle them:
Right to Access: Your data is available directly via the API or user commands. That is everything we have.
Right to Erasure: Self-service via API/commands. Note: Deleting essential data (like User ID) effectively deletes your account.
Right to Rectification: If data is wrong, run the update command again.
Right to Complain: You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) if you
    think we are mishandling your data. (We'd prefer you yell at us first so we can fix it, but you do you).
To exercise these rights (other than self-service), contact us. We usually process requests faster than a government bureaucracy.

CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
We may update this policy at any time.
We'll try to announce it in the Discord server, but let's be honest, which you'll probably read just as closely.
