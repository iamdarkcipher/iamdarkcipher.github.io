Terms of Service

1. Acceptance of Terms
By using our Discord App and all related content (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to these Terms of
    Service ("Terms"). If you disagree, don't use the Service. Seriously.

2. The Service "The Service" is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" - legal speak for "it is what it is".
    We disclaim all warranties, express or implied. We don't guarantee it will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.
    If it breaks, you get both pieces.

3. Intellectual Property
All code, assets, IP, and content (the "IP") are ours.
You get a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service as intended.
Don't steal our stuff.

4. Restrictions on Use
You are explicitly prohibited from:
    Reverse-engineering, decompiling, or trying to discover the source code. Just use it.
    Scraping, data mining, or extracting data or content.
    Using the Service, its data, or IP for any AI training or derivative works. This clause overrides "fair use" or any other excuse your robot army can think of.
    Using the Service for any illegal purpose. Behave.

5. Limitation of Liability
Our favorite part:
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, ETC.) FROM:

    YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE;
    UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS;
    ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF THE SERVICE;
    ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, OR TROJAN HORSES (we hope not, but we're covered);
    ANY DATA LOSS, INCLUDING AUDIT DATA, REGARDLESS OF SUBSCRIPTION.

YOU AGREE OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS IS ZERO ($0.00) DOLLARS. Yes, a crisp zero.

6. Data and Subscriptions
Data (receipts, logs, etc.) is "best effort" because low costs are our jam.
    Access is a privilege, not a right. We can delete any data, anytime, without notice, even if you pay.
    Deletions are final. See the Privacy Policy for gory details.

7. Indemnification
If your actions get us sued, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless. In short: you break it, you buy it.

8. Termination
We can terminate or suspend your access anytime, for any reason, without notice. Don't test us.

9. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The boring legal part.

10. Changes to Terms
We can modify these Terms anytime. Your continued use of the Service means you accept the changes.
