Privacy Policy

1. Introduction
We are committed to protecting your privacy while keeping our operational costs low,
    because we're not data-hungry vampires.
    This policy explains our data practices for the Discord Application and all related services (the "Service").

2. Information We Collect
We strive to collect as little as possible.

Non-PII: We may collect Non-PII needed for the Service to work, like your Discord User ID,
    Server ID, and virtual identities (e.g., game character names).
No Real PII: We do not intentionally request or store real-world PII (real name, address, etc.). We don't want it.

3. User-Submitted PII
If you voluntarily provide real-world PII in any free-form text field, you do so at your own risk.
    We make reasonable security attempts but assume no responsibility or liability for it.
    Seriously, why would you do that?

4. Data Storage and Deletion
To keep costs low, our data retention is minimal. We are big fans of the 'delete' key.

Unmanaged Data: Data from inactive accounts may be permanently deleted at any time without notice to manage costs.
    This includes data not vital to another user's subscription. All deletions are unrecoverable.
Audit Data: Audit artifacts (e.g., images) may be processed for metadata, and the original artifact deleted.
    The metadata then becomes "Unmanaged Data" and is subject to deletion.
    This data is a privilege, not a right, and may be deleted without notice, even during an active subscription.
    Poof. Gone.

5. How We Use Information
We use collected info solely to operate, maintain, and provide the Service.
    We do not sell or share your information, except as required by law.

Your interaction with Discord is governed by their policies. We are not responsible for Discord's data practices.
    That's a "you and them" problem.

6. Data Security
We implement reasonable security, but no system is 100% secure. We can't guarantee absolute security.
    We're not Fort Knox. If we learn of a significant security issue, we'll make a reasonable effort to inform you.
    Our liability is limited as defined in our Terms of Service (to $0.00, remember?).

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy at any time, which you'll probably read just as closely.
