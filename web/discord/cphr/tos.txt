Terms of Service

PREFACE: THE NECESSARY EVIL
Welcome to the legal text.
We know you want to skip this, but we can't let you in unless you agree to the rules.
We've tried to make this readable, but where the "Plain English" explanation conflicts with the "Legal Text",
    the Legal Text wins.

1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
By accessing or using the application and all related content (collectively, the "Service"), you acknowledge
    that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms").
Using the Service constitutes a binding legal agreement.
If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately cease all use of the Service.
By using, you agree. No take-backs.

2. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES ("AS IS")
The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or
    implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
    or non-infringement.
We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.
Furthermore, we do not guarantee the accuracy of any game data, stats, calculations, or trade logs.
If you trade your spaceship based on our math and it turns out we forgot to carry the one, that is on you.
Do not make financial decisions based on a Discord bot.
We promise nothing. If it breaks, you get both pieces.

3. ELIGIBILITY AND PARENTAL SUPERVISION
You must be at least 13 years of age (or older if required by digital consent laws in your jurisdiction) to use this Service.
If you are under the age of 18, you represent and warrant that you have obtained verifiable consent from a parent or
    legal guardian.
The responsibility for monitoring usage lies entirely with the parent or guardian.
We aren't paid enough to babysit. If you are 12, go play outside.
If you are 14 and drain your parents' credit card, that is a 'them' problem, not an 'us' problem.

4. THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS
This Service operates within and relies upon third-party platforms, including but not limited to Discord.
Your use of the Service is subject to the respective Terms of Service and Privacy Policies of these third parties.
We make reasonable efforts to comply with third-party policies, but we explicitly disclaim all liability for any and
    all interactions, disputes, data loss, bans, or issues of any kind arising from your relationship with or use of
    these third-party platforms.
This includes situations where an upstream API change (eg from Discord or CIG) causes our bot to malfunction, spam your
    server, or delete data.
We dance to their tune, and sometimes they change the song without telling us.
We accept no liability for third-party service interruptions, policy changes, or account restrictions.
If Discord bans you, don't cry to us. We don't have the keys to their castle.

5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & LICENSE
a) Ownership: All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including but not limited to code, assets, and
    proprietary content, remain our exclusive property.
   You are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to use the Service in accordance with these Terms.
b) User Content: You retain ownership of content you submit (e.g., logs, messages, images, metadata).
   By submitting such content, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license (subject to your deletion
    rights under our Privacy Policy) to use, display, and modify said content solely for the purpose of operating
    the Service.
   You represent and warrant that any content you upload is not illegal, obscene, hateful, radioactive or otherwise
    violates any terms of our dependent platforms.
   If you upload something that gets the MI5 knocking on our door, you agree to indemnify us for the therapy costs.
   We need these permissions just to display your username on screen without getting sued, as an example.
c) Feedback: Any suggestions, feature requests, or feedback provided regarding the Service may be used by us without
    obligation or compensation to you.
   Ideas are free; code costs money. Don't expect royalties just for suggesting dark mode.

6. COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT NOTICES
We respect the intellectual property rights of others.
If you believe that any material available on or through the Service infringes upon any copyright you own or control,
    please immediately notify us with a detailed description of the alleged infringement.
We will respond to valid, written notices of alleged infringement.
Formal disclosures get handled. Caps-lock rants in #general get muted.

7. RESTRICTIONS ON USE
You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities:
    a) Reverse-engineering, decompiling, or attempting to derive source code from the Service. Just use it.
    b) Scraping, data mining, or extracting data via any method, protocol, or interface other than the official user
        interface or explicitly documented APIs.
       This includes accessing the Service at a rate or purpose that exceeds normal human usage.
    c) Using the Service, its data, or IP for any AI training or derivative works. This clause overrides "fair use" or any
        other excuse your robot army can think of.
    d) Using the Service for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose.
It's a Discord bot, not the Enigma machine. Find something better to do.

8. MANDATORY LIABILITY (STATUTORY RIGHTS)
Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence,
    for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or for any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under the
    laws of England and Wales.
If our code literally explodes and hurts you, and the law says that's on us, fair enough.

9. EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES
    ARISING FROM, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

a) YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE;
b) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICE;
c) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS;
d) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF THE SERVICE;
e) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, OR TROJAN HORSES (we hope not, but just so we're covered);
f) ANY DATA LOSS, INCLUDING AUDIT DATA, REGARDLESS OF SUBSCRIPTION.
e) Selling, renting, leasing, transferring, or giving access to your account or data to any third party, regardless of
    whether such transfer is voluntary or involuntary (e.g., due to scams, lack of 2FA, or poor security practices).
   You are solely responsible for protecting your account.

We aren't liable for side effects. Depression caused by our dark mode is tragic, but not actionable.

10. VOLUNTARY ASSUMPTION OF RISK
You expressly waive any claim of liability against us for damages arising from your continued use of the Service during
    periods of known vulnerability, including but not limited to high-profile security disclosures or
    publicised exploits.
If the news says we are on fire and you log in anyway, that is entirely on you.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (CAP)
In the event that we are found liable for any direct damages not otherwise excluded by these Terms, our total
    cumulative liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to the Service shall not exceed the
    greater of:

    a) Fifty British Pounds Sterling (£50.00 GBP); or
    b) the lesser of what you paid for the affected period or the total amount paid by you to us for use of the Service
        during the three (3) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
For a free app, fifty quid is generous. Don't spend it all at once.

12. FORCE MAJEURE
We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations where such failure results from causes beyond our
    reasonable control, including but not limited to mechanical, electronic, or communications failure, acts of God,
    or third-party API outages.
When sharks (or Rus*cough*sia) eat the internet cables, or the Discord API goes down (again), it's not our fault.

13. DATA RETENTION AND MANAGEMENT
All data storage is provided on a "best effort" basis.
We reserve the right to delete, archive, or modify user data at any time without prior notice to manage operational
    costs or performance.
We're cheapskates. Low costs are our jam. If you want permanent storage, buy a hard drive.

14. PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS
If applicable, payment for subscriptions does not constitute a guarantee of data retention or immunity from moderation.
All fees are non-refundable unless required by law.
Your wallet is welcome, but immortality is permanently out of stock.

15. INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from and against any claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from your violation of these Terms or your use of the Service.
If you do something stupid that gets us sued, you're paying our legal bills.

16. TERMINATION
We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability,
    for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
We have a ban hammer and we aren't afraid to use it. Don't test us.

17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION (CLASS ACTION WAIVER)
To the fullest extend permitted by applicable law, disputes shall be resolved solely on an individual basis.
You explicitly waive your right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated,
    or representative action.
1v1 me. No raid parties in court.

18. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.
You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in London, United Kingdom.
Tea, crumpets, and the High Court of Justice. Pack an umbrella.

19. SURVIVAL
Upon termination, all provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive will survive, including, without
    limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
Even if you leave (or we ban you), these rules haunt you forever.

20. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be modified to the minimum
    extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
If a judge nerfs one rule, the rest doesn't crumble like a dry cookie.

21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service and supersede all prior or
    contemporaneous agreements, understandings, or representations, whether written or oral.
Screenshots of promises made at 3 AM in #general don't count.

22. ASSIGNMENT
You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.
We may assign or transfer these Terms, at our sole discretion, without restriction.
We can sell the bot. You can't sell your account.

23. MODIFICATIONS
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time.
We will attempt to provide notice of significant changes via the Discord server.
Your continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
We'll ping @everyone. You'll ignore it. We'll update the rules anyway. The cycle of life.

24. CONTACT
Legal notices and sensitive disclosures must be directed to the developer.
